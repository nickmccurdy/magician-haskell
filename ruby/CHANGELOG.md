## 0.3.1
- Drop the dependency on jeweler and use files generated by bundle gem instead

## 0.3.0
- Features
  - Add Math.primes, which implements a fast prime sieve
  - Add Array#numerics, which finds all Numerics in an Array
  - Add Array#middle, an unsorted version of Array#median
  - Add Numeric#to_radians and Numeric#to_degrees for conversion
  - Add #boolean, #coin, and #die class/instance methods to the Random class
  - Add an alias for Complex::I
- Changes
  - If an Array method that uses Numerics is called on an Array with non-Numeric
    objects, magician will raise a RuntimeError instead of filtering out
    non-Numeric objects without warning
  - Methods will now tend to prefer raising descriptive errors over returning
    nil without warning
  - Support making Math.fibs start with any set of two or more terms
  - Simplify and clean up some of the source code
- Fixes
  - Fix several issues with Integer#pandigital?
  - Update the changelog to include changes in previous version 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

- Add examples to the readme, along with a link to magician's docs
- Minor code style improvements
- Move the divisible? instance method from Integer to Numeric so it can be used

  contain Numeric objects
